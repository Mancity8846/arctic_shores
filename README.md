To be honest i could have coded this in anything (i already have a java framwork set up on my laptop). However i check regularly new tools and have wanted to check out Katalon for a while so this killed two birds with one stone. 

In my opinion Katalon is ok, very similar to Cypress, very restrictive to how they want you to code to and its very IDE heavy. I prefer the old style of Using tools like TestNG etc along with something like Mocha, Chai etc and use a page object style of framework.

If you require me to redo this please let me know
